# Pathfinding

## Introduction
The idea behind this project is to create implementations of the most widely used pathfinding algorithms in different languages.
All of these implementations have a user interface, so it's easy to try them out.

## Note
The main focus of this project is to provide multiple implementations of the algorithms in different languages to help as many people as I can.
However there will be no step by step guides (other than the code documentation). If you are unfamiliar with the algorithms or the basic of pathfinding consider a reading about them before proceeding (there are multiple great tutorials).
